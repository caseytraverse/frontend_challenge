Frontend assignment for Bloc. My goal was to code a list-view design appropriate for my chosen operating system (iOS) that incorporates the guidelines for the chosen platform and the visual styling that I applied to the Visual Challenge. 

I applied newly-acquired frontend skills to build bus routes view for an independent project called 'BusyBus.' The expectations were two-fold; 1. Accurately utilize HTML and CSS to build a solution that is responsive. 2. Deploy project to Github.
